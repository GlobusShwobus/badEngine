1) clone repo
2) be familiar with vcpkg. Following both versions are fine but slightly different. First is probably the easiest:

3) Install dependencies manually
	as per above guides either using <vcpkg add port [tag]> or <vcpkg install [tag]>

The following are the tags:

sdl3
sdl3-image
imgui
imgui[sdl3-binding]
imgui[sdl3-renderer-binding]
imgui[sdlgpu3-binding]
